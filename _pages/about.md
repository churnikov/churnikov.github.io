## I'm Nikita, Machine Learning Engineer from Stockholm 

## As a Person...

I lived in different cities and two countries up until that point.

I lived in Saint Petersburg for more than 20 years and in Moscow for three years. Now I'm in Stockholm, and trying to
understand this city and find its beauties. In this blog I write about what I found and what I want to remember and
share with the World.

In my free time I play various games, read, take photos, meet with friends and write this blog.

## As a Developer...

For 7 years I worked primarily with python and applied it to a variety of tasks: Machine Learning in NLP, Drug discovery
and Computer vision. Developed REST APIs for these models, web applications using Flask and Django and cli apps with
python std library or click library.

I'm also interested in Julia and rust languages in general and in C++ for computer vision.

My full CV as a developer is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/churnikov/).
