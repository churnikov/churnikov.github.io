## I'm Nikita, Machine Learning Engineer from Stockholm 

## As a Person...

I lived in different cities and two countries up until that point.

I lived in Saint Petersburg for more than 20 years and in Moscow for three years. Now I'm Stockholm, and trying to
understand this city and find its beauties. In this blog I write about what I found and what I want to remember and
share with the World.

## As a Developer...

For 7 years I worked primarily with python and applying it to variety of tasks: Machine Learning in NLP, Life sciences
and Computer vision, web applications, cli apps.
