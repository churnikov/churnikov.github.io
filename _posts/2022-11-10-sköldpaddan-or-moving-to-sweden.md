We've moved Sweden on 18th of September 2022. To get there we left Saint-Petersburg on 16th, went to Helsinki by bus and on the 17th took the ferry to Stockholm. 

Without details it fits into two sentences, but I want to add details. If you want to know them read this post.

## Doing all the legal things right

As Russian citizens we have some number of things we have to do before and after we leave. And some things are not required by law, but are really nice to do.

I can recommend to read through these pages, at least the first one and apply this knowledge to your case.

But in short, we did the following:

[x] Order a power of attorney (–¥–æ–≤–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å) for someone you trust <br>
[ ] Take the documents <br>
[x] Protect all things from dust <br>

## Buying tickets and accomondation
As you might know, Russia is under sanctions right now, and Russian cards doen't work outside of Russia.

And we needed 4 things to get to Stockholm and not stay on the street:

[ ] Tickets from Saint Petersburg to Helsinki <br>
[ ] Place to stay for one night in Helsinki (Just in case there would have been problems on the border) <br>
[ ] Tickets from Helsinki to Stockholm <br>
[ ] Place to stay in Stockholm <br>

Yeah, we need to take such a long route, because there are no direct flights or ferries to Stockholm from Saint Petersburg or Moscow. The only alternative was taking a plane via some southern countries that still fly to Russia.

**So what we did ourselves**

To get to Helsinki we bought tickets from [Ecolines] it was possible to do with Russian debt card. Fortunately, we were also able to book a hotel via booking.com.

We were able to do that, I think, only because we had a card tethered to my booking account. If we had not, we might have had to use ozon travel or aviasales and such.

**What we were able to do only because we had friends and family abroad**

We wanted to take a ferry to Stockholm, because it did not restrict us in terms of weight and amount of bags we could carry. But the problem was that Silia ferries did not _as you might have guessed_ Russian debt cards. So we asked my friend in Armenia to pay for us and sent him money back in rubles. As for the accommodation, my wife has an uncle in Canada, who agreed to pay for two months of stay. And father of my wife returned him this money via swift transfer.

## Packing up

## From Saint Petersburg to Helsinki
16th of September. Five days before announcement of the Draft (Mobilization). We knew that it's going to happen, because all the knews were about it. Government people denied it as usual. All analytics were talking why it'll happen, depite it being unpopular. Every day from 12th (TODO: check) till 16th we were checking news on that. But everything was allright whan we left.

We bus was leaving at 14:00 MSK. On the day before Irina came to Saint-Petersburg. We rented an appartment for her close to us, so she just came to our place and we took a taxi to the bus station. For some reason, there were huge trafic jams in the city and I was worried that we are going to be late. But we arrived 20 minutes before departure. My parents go the place 5 minutes before departure. We were standing in the queue on the bus and she called me on the phone, crying. They were standing at the fence of the station, 10 meters from us. I told her to come inside the station, so that we could say goodbye properly. She did not hear it, she was crying in my ear. So I asked Tanya to look after our things and ran into the station building. We hugged for the last time, and I ran back. They were stating at the fence again. I called them and we agreed to stay in touch. When the bus took off I started crying. I cryed for 20 minutes I think.

It's funny actually, Tanya and I went to the Helsinki for first time as friends and returned as a couple. And now we were going there after 3 years. From my point of view, the trip to the border was really fast. 3 years ago it felt like forever to get there and now it felt like we've just got on a bus and now have to disembark.

At the border I started to worry that we had to have travel insurances, despite that I've googled before and found no information on this requirement. It turned out that we were not required to have these insurances. That was a relive eventually, but at the moment I was a bit afraid.

![Cafe at the border: source: https://yandex.ru/maps/?l=pht&ll=27.922372%2C60.595839&mode=poi&photos%5Bid%5D=N71XIc7wPKEeGdbMl1FYFA&photos%5Boid%5D=img_15530549%3A477639&photos%5Bpoint%5D=27.922760%2C60.596060&poi%5Bpoint%5D=27.913096%2C60.596099&poi%5Buri%5D=ymapsbm1%3A%2F%2Forg%3Foid%3D218492356353&z=17.76](../../assets/images/sk√∂ldpaddan-or-moving-to-sweden/spb-torfyanovka.jpeg)

At the actual Russian border we were asked to take all our stuff outside and walk through with it. As we had a lot of things and more, we were not happy by this requirement, but we did not argue of course. Basically we were low mobility people when we were with our baggage, so every minor obstacle was like a huge challenge. For example, Tanya could not pull up luggage on her own, so I had to drop everything it help out. But slowly, as a turtle, we crawled our way inside the building. There we were greeted by already formed queue. Bus driver asked all passengers with foreign or double citizenship to come first. There were a few of them. I think five or ten passengers were in that situation. As we later heard with almost all them everything was okay, but one of us had to stay at the border. It was a Ukrainian citizen. That was not great, and we were really sorry him. At the [–ü–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª—å (Border control)] we read stories about this, so it was not that shocking, but still, We are deeply sorry for every person, who could not get out.

Slowly, the queue got to us. During that time, we both felt suffocating as if there were not enough air in the building. Tanya had to walk around in order to not faint and I was getting sleepy. But we got to the checkpoint eventually. There we had to quickly put our bags on the x-ray lane and answer questions regarding our belongings at the same time. Again, we prepared for it, thanks to [–ü–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª—å (Border control)]. They asked us how much money did we have, why we were going abroad. But interestingly enough, they asked us about our medicine. We in fact did have some pills with us, but it was just some iboprophen medicine for stoma Tanya had to walk around in order to not faint and I was getting sleepy. But we got to the checkpoint eventually. There we had to quickly put our bags on the x-ray lane and answer questions regarding our belongings at the same time. Again, we prepared for it, thanks to [–ü–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª—å (Border control)]. They asked us some expected questions like how money did we carry, where were we going. But it was unexpected that they asked us about medicine that we were caring. We had just some ibuprofen and tablet against allergies.

And then there was another queue, but for document checking. In short, we passed it and were excited to leave.

The difference between Russian border land and Finnish is so drastic. Russian buildings look so cheap and dirty. Finland's border on the other hand had even fresher air. Maybe we were just happy to leave, but yeah, it was great to go away from all this mess. At the Finnish border they didn't ask anything from us, we just went to the checkpoint with documents, got no questions and left. Many people when we crossed the border were calling their relatives and they seemed happy. So did we, before disconnecting from Russian cellular network.

At the time when we continued our journey, it started to get dark really quickly. During our ride to Helsinki we've faced many familiar shops that were in Saint Petersburg: KRuoka, KRauta, Prisma, some gas stations that we had back at home and offices of huge companies like Samsung. It was really nice to be back after so long. I missed this feeling of excitement due to meeting something foreign.

### At the Helsinki

There were two stops of our bus in Helsinki. One at the Airport and the other at the bus station (Kampi). We were going to the second stop. But almost whole bus was going to the Airport. When we left the Airport there were only 6 people on the bus, including us, two bus drivers.

We quickly got to the bus station got off and started crawling like a turtle towards the Hotel. The hotel was not that far from bus station according to the map, but with the number of bags we had it was a challenge.

![helsinki-from-kampi-to-hotel](../../assets/images/sk√∂ldpaddan-or-moving-to-sweden/helsinki-from-kampi-to-hotel.png)

The moment we picked out things up I started to doubt that it was a good idea to take scooters with us. The fact that we had to carry backpacks, scooters and two suitcases per person.. I really did not imagine how hard will it be to carry. But there was nothing left to do. We had to get to the Hotel. Right now I can't believe that it was just one kilometer, because it felt like 5 kilometers and we were going there not 12 minutes, but 30 or 40. During the time we were going there I was thinking about conveniences for low mobility people. Like how how hard it is for an old lady must be going to some place. And how hard it is to walk around Russian cities with their holes in the ground and not working elevators. 

Firstly, when we got off the bus and took our stuff, we had to get out from the Kampi station. Fortunately, there was an elevator that took us to the street. At that time we were approaching our low mobility head on and did not look around in order to know our surroundings. We looked at the map and went how it was showing us. Unfortunately [2] we did not have internet at the time, but I've downloaded maps of Stockholm and Helsinki. And so we had to figure out how to get to our destination almost the old way. As I understand now, we made a big loop compared to google maps suggested route. Maybe that's one of the reasons why our crawl felt like an hour.
