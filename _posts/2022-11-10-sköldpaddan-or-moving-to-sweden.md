We moved to Sweden on the 18th of September 2022. Our journey began in Saint-Petersburg on the 16th, 
from where we traveled to Helsinki by bus. On the 17th, we boarded a ferry to Stockholm.

While this summary captures the essence of our move in two sentences, there's so much more to the 
story. If you're interested in the details, continue reading this post.

# Prepare for boarding!

Our journey began well before the 16th of September. It truly started when my wife, Tanya, received her 
offer from KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) in Stockholm in July 2022. We spent two months preparing 
for our move, and there was much to be done.

## Useful resources

As Russian citizens, there are several things we need to address both before and after our departure. 
While some of these tasks aren't legally required, they are highly recommended.

I recommend reading through these pages, especially the first one, and applying the knowledge to your 
situation.

The best guide, in my opinion: [Where and how to leave Russia](https://equanity.notion.site/equanity/6bb0d8655cf44d25993fb11d14456d5e)

This guide is still up-to-date as of September 2023.
{:.notice--info}

The majority of these guides are not up-to-date, but they may still contain useful information:

- [How to live abroad: Guide for IT guys (but not only) 2022](https://vkvkvk.notion.site/2022-c8c3dd17bd474866ae8c3e1a36327a92)

The following appears to be the most comprehensive list of chats:

Additionally, there are channels that share personal experiences about interactions with the Russian 
border and military:

- [Interactions with Russian military](https://t.me/+LeSzDEZGpak4MzMy)

## Buying tickets and accommodation

As of 2023, due to sanctions, Russian cards don't work outside of Russia. This poses significant 
challenges, especially for those looking to book in advance or move to Sweden.

For our journey to Stockholm, we needed:

- Tickets from Saint-Petersburg to Helsinki
- A one-night stay in Helsinki (just in case there were problems at the border)
- Tickets from Helsinki to Stockholm
- Accommodation in Stockholm

We had to take such a long route because there are no direct flights or ferries from Saint Petersburg 
or Moscow to Stockholm. The only alternative was flying via certain southern countries that still 
maintain flight connections with Russia.

However, flying imposed stricter luggage restrictions. We had numerous items to bring, and we wanted to 
avoid overthinking our luggage.

Below is a table comparing the costs for two people, round trip. Airplane prices range from the 
cheapest to the most convenient options.

| Airplane   | Bus-Hotel-Ferry          |
|:----------:|:------------------------:|
|‚Ç¨1294-‚Ç¨4449 | 232‚Ç¨ + 164‚Ç¨ + 252‚Ç¨ = 648‚Ç¨|

Clearly, the bus-hotel-ferry combination was the most cost-effective and convenient way to reach 
Stockholm.

**So what we did ourselves**

To get to Helsinki, we bought tickets from [Ecolines](https://ecolines.ru/ru/ru). Fortunately, it was 
possible to make the purchase with a Russian debit card. We also managed to book a hotel via booking.com 
because the card linked to my profile was still accepted. However, I'm uncertain if this would work for 
a newly registered account.

I believe we could do that only because we had a card linked to my booking account. If not, we might 
have had to resort to platforms like ozon travel or aviasales.
{: .notice--info} 

**What we were able to do only because we had friends and family abroad**

We aimed to take a [Silja ferry](https://en.tallink.com/book-a-cruise) to Stockholm since it didn't 
impose weight or baggage quantity restrictions. However, as you might have already guessed, Silja 
ferries did not accept Russian debit cards. So, we asked my friend in Armenia to pay on our behalf, 
and we reimbursed him in rubles via his Russian bank account. For accommodation, my wife's uncle in 
Canada agreed to cover two months of our stay, and my wife's father reimbursed him via a SWIFT transfer.

It's worth noting that without my Armenian friend, David, and our international connections, we 
couldn't have managed certain payments, like the Swedish council fee. Reflecting on this, I often 
thought about individuals from remote Russian regions without such connections. We truly are fortunate 
in this aspect.

## Packing up

I made a concerted effort to prepare us optimally for this trip. In this section, I'll describe 
what worked well, what didn't, and provide some updates based on future experiences.

### Conserving home

At that time, we genuinely believed we would return to Russia for the New Year (Ha-ha, Mobilization). 
Given the extended absence, I decided to store as many items as possible in [vacuum bags](https://www.ozon.ru/product/vakuumnye-pakety-dlya-odezhdy-10-sht-s-nasosom-mnogorazovye-pakety-dlya-igrushek-odeyal-i-puhovikov-1012205871/?advert=Oa5vKLX9OsrIDpKYqiHpIrXuHNn1vlYtW-GVgMx2S7j8ZQjcea7IoSwB__ZqyXGm2NmIjz2G8cC3_PNdm7OwlcpvOLQ9W-WqGL1538PXKoSaoBwow_PB03OPUtXRsdvTw2IT_zGnXYmG5VLSknrJ8dJRTfSvupApuXEtx0ENXil-XtWvzgwf1ePnfwFLgR7TpYFekQ&avtc=1&avte=2&avts=1695330361&sh=j2TZ1o3pPQ).

I attempted to wrap the furniture as well, but couldn't complete it, so I essentially abandoned the idea.

**Update from August 2023:**<br>
It seems to work quite well. My parents tell me that our apartment in Saint-Petersburg neither smells 
stale nor like old clothes. The items themselves don't accumulate much dust. Upon returning from Moscow, 
Tanya mentioned that our apartment wasn't very dusty. Still, I believe it was a good decision.

### Taking stuff with us

This is where our plan shone. The majority of our choices proved to be good. However, I wish 
I had known about this website before packing: [packhacker.com](https://packhacker.com/).

- **Packing cubes:** I opted for pretty basic ones, but they served as effective organizers. 
  Specifically, cubes for [cables](https://www.ozon.ru/product/nesesser-dlya-hraneniya-provodov-doma-ili-v-doroge-nit-perfect-goods-tsvet-siniy-472882481/?asb=%252FU4SJXbdMjePjj%252F7p3XLgFG96%252FDdlFHeexgX3xeKkRPnolWKO6o49d5L5Sk8BuIs&asb2=u3ewThpX-7Gbhrhna64_hB_eD_2wc1g_T0QljsCZWc4mOONkvOTqqQJzwqPR3G8QTnzutiVXwEwRkgoFGBuzq9JCkrSY61wWQTDpuEOrt_R4MlnY7Q0FvS9dY8VXKcOgOQv37qRjjqDtFKRg6gFbFcS9v5-Ez1JAEk3txtu_gcI&avtc=1&avte=2&avts=1695331003&keywords=%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%89%D0%B8+%D0%B2+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%83&sh=j2TZ1vfeaw),

**Update from August 2023:**<br>
But again, I highly recommend checking out the packing lists on [packhacker.com](https://packhacker.com/). 
While I relied on common sense and didn't consult any guides, their packing lists are much more 
comprehensive.

### Scooters üõ¥

When we were getting ready and evaluating our potential living areas, I explored our surroundings 
on Google Street View. The abundance of bike lanes in Stockholm looked promising. Additionally, 
videos from [Varlamov](https://www.youtube.com/@ilyavrlmv) encouraged us to try scooters. So we 
did. It was an immediate oversight, not catastrophic, but regrettable.

The issue was that we brought many items with us, and the scooters felt like the straw that 
might break the camel's back. Fortunately, it didn't come to that, but it was a close call. In 
Stockholm, it turned out that scooters weren't particularly useful. The buses are efficient, 
and the pavements aren't scooter-friendly.

**Update from August 2023:**<br>
We really didn't need the scooters. They turned out to be inconvenient in Stockholm. The 
pavement is rough, there are many hills, and it's often wet. A bike would definitely be a 
better choice here.

## From Saint Petersburg to Helsinki

Five days before the announcement of the Draft (Mobilization), we knew it was going to happen 
because all the news was about it. [Government officials denied it as 
usual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8aFyA6hW78). All analysts [were discussing why it would 
happen](https://meduza.io/feature/2022/09/20/kazhetsya-v-rossii-vseriez-gotovyat-mobilizatsiyu-i-radi-etogo-dazhe-perepisali-ugolovnyy-kodeks-chto-delat-esli-ya-ne-hochu-voevat), 
despite its unpopularity. Every day from the 12th to the 16th, we checked the news about it. 
But everything was alright when we left.

The bus was scheduled to leave at 14:00 MSK. The day before, Irina (Tanya's Mother) arrived in 
Saint-Petersburg. We rented an apartment for her nearby, so she just came to our place, and we 
took a taxi to the bus station. For some reason, there were significant traffic jams in the 
city, and I was concerned we might be late. However, we arrived 20 minutes before departure. My 
parents arrived at the place 5 minutes before the bus left. We were in the queue for the bus 
when Mom called me, crying. They were by the station's fence, just 10 meters away. I told her 
to come inside so we could say our goodbyes properly. She didn't hear me; she was sobbing. I 
asked Tanya to watch our belongings and ran into the station. We hugged one last time, and I 
rushed back. They were at the fence again. I called them, and we agreed to stay in touch. As 
the bus pulled away, I began to cry, a sorrow that lasted for about 20 minutes.

{% include video id="huSW52e3RKU" width="111" provider="youtube" caption="My awesome video" %}

When I calmed down, I felt this joy and excitement from the trip ahead. I remembered how Tanya 
and I went to Helsinki for the first time as friends and returned as a couple in 2019. And now 
we were going there as a family after 3 years. From my perspective, the trip to the border was 
swift. Three years ago, it felt like an eternity to get there, but now it seemed like we'd 
just boarded the bus and suddenly needed to disembark.

At the border, I began to worry that we might need travel insurances, even though my prior 
research found no such requirement. It turned out we weren't required to have these 
insurances. That was a relief eventually, but in the moment, I felt apprehensive. Maybe that 
was a general symptom of the excitement and worry about the border.

It also felt more and more daunting as we approached, especially since the cell network 
stopped functioning. At the actual border, there was a cafe with a torn billboard. The sight 
was disheartening.

![Cafe at the border: source: https://yandex.ru/maps/?l=pht&ll=27.922372%2C60.595839&mode=poi&photos%5Bid%5D=N71XIc7wPKEeGdbMl1FYFA&photos%5Boid%5D=img_15530549%3A477639&photos%5Bpoint%5D=27.922760%2C60.596060&poi%5Bpoint%5D=27.913096%2C60.596099&poi%5Buri%5D=ymapsbm1%3A%2F%2Forg%3Foid%3D218492356353&z=17.76](../../assets/images/sk√∂ldpaddan-or-moving-to-sweden/spb-torfyanovka.jpeg)

At the Russian border checkpoint, we were asked to take all our belongings outside and walk 
through with them. Given the amount of luggage we had, we were not pleased with this 
requirement, but of course, we didn't argue. Essentially, with our baggage, our mobility was 
severely limited, so every minor obstacle felt like a major challenge. For instance, Tanya 
couldn't lift the luggage on her own, so I had to drop everything and assist. But slowly, like 
a turtle, we made our way inside the building. There, we were greeted by an already-formed 
queue. The bus driver asked all passengers with foreign or dual citizenship to come forward 
first. A few, maybe five or ten, had such status. From what we gathered, most of them faced no 
issues, but one passenger had to stay at the border. He was a Ukrainian citizen. That was 
unfortunate, and we felt really sorry for him. At the [Border control](https://t.me/+yHACAsBxEXo4OGEy), 
we'd read stories about such incidents, so while it wasn't shocking, our hearts went out to 
every individual who couldn't make it across.

{% include gallery id="ru-fi-border" caption="Russian-Finnish border" %}

Slowly, the queue got to us. During that time, we both felt suffocating as if there wasn't 
enough air in the building. Tanya had to walk around to avoid fainting, and I was getting 
sleepy. Eventually, we reached the checkpoint. There, we had to quickly place our bags on the 
x-ray lane and answer questions about our belongings simultaneously. We were prepared for this, 
thanks to [–ü–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª—å (Border control)](https://t.me/+yHACAsBxEXo4OGEy). They asked 
us how much money we had and why we were going abroad. Interestingly, they inquired about our 
medicine. We only had some ibuprofen and allergy tablets.

Then there was another queue for document checking. In short, we passed it and were eager to 
leave.

The difference between Russian borderland and Finland's is stark. Russian buildings appear 
cheap and dirty. On the other hand, Finland's border seemed to have even fresher air. Perhaps 
we were just relieved to leave, but it felt great to move away from the chaos. At the Finnish 
border, they didn't question us; we simply presented our documents, received no queries, and 
departed. Many people called their relatives as we crossed the border, expressing joy. We felt 
the same, at least until we disconnected from the Russian cellular network.

As we continued our journey, darkness quickly set in. During our ride to Helsinki, we saw many 
familiar shops that also exist in Saint Petersburg: KRuoka, KRauta, Prisma, some gas stations 
we recognized, and offices of major companies like Samsung. It was comforting to be back after 
so long. I had missed the thrill of encountering something foreign.

### At the Helsinki

There were two stops for our bus in Helsinki. One at the Airport and the other at the bus 
station (Kamppi). We were headed to the second stop. But almost the entire bus was headed to 
the Airport. When we left the Airport, only six people remained on the bus, including us and 
the two bus drivers.

We quickly reached the bus station, got off, and started moving at a turtle's pace towards the 
Hotel. The hotel wasn't that far from the bus station according to the map, but with the number 
of bags we had, it was a challenge.


<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" async src="https://api-maps.yandex.ru/services/constructor/1.0/js/?um=constructor%3Aff2cf9857193c07158d79573551b019dafa0a82e3b64c3c2d092e1ec6db1b410&amp;width=100%25&amp;height=503&amp;lang=en_FR&amp;scroll=true"></script>

The moment we picked our things up, I started to doubt that it was a good idea to take scooters 
with us. The fact that we had to carry backpacks, scooters, and two suitcases per person... I 
really did not imagine how hard it would be to carry. But there was nothing left to do. We had 
to get to the hotel. Right now, I can't believe it was just one kilometer because it felt like 
five kilometers, and it took us not 12 minutes but 30 or 40. During that time, I thought about 
the challenges faced by those with limited mobility. Like how hard it must be for an elderly 
person to navigate. And how challenging it is to navigate Russian cities with their uneven 
surfaces and non-functional elevators.

First, when we got off the bus and gathered our belongings, we had to exit the Kamppi station. 
Fortunately, there was an elevator that took us to the street. At that time, we were directly 
confronting our limited mobility and didn't take the time to familiarize ourselves with our 
surroundings. We consulted the map and followed its directions. Unfortunately, we didn't have 
internet access, but I had downloaded maps of Stockholm and Helsinki. Thus, we had to navigate 
to our destination in an almost old-fashioned way. As I understand now, we took a much longer 
route compared to the one suggested by Google Maps. Perhaps that's why our journey felt so 
lengthy.

## From Helsinki to Stockholm

I still remember the breakfast at the hotel. The salted fish was exceptional.

When we were done with the breakfast, we packed and left our luggage at the hotel. We took some 
time to walk around the city. We went to the railway station and took some pictures. We also 
went to the shopping mall and bought some food for the road.

{% include gallery id="helsinki-views" caption="Some city views" %}

Our luggage problems arose again. We had to get to the ferry terminal with it. Fortunately, we 
were able to get a taxi from the hotel.

When we got to the terminal, it was still some time until the boarding. So I decided to grab 
some salted fish sandwiches from the Helsinki market.

## First impressions

Up until that point we had little to no problems with not having a working bank card. Sure, it 
was a bit inconvenient, but euro cash in Finland was fine.

But the moment we stepped on the shore of Stockholm, we realized that we had to get to the 
hotel. And while figuring out what to do, we realized that all taxis were gone, there were no 
people at the terminal, and we didn't really know where to go from there. Thinking about it 
now, we should have asked for help from friends who were in Stockholm or either of our 
employers. But we had to do something right now.

So we spent some time configuring terminal wifi, setting up Revolut, and trying to register in 
taxi apps using it. It didn't work.

While doing this, terminal personnel started to arrive. I asked them what we should do in our 
situation. They told us that we should go to T-Centralen (Stockholm Central Station), change 
euro/dollars to Swedish crowns, and then buy an SL card there. That sounded like a plan.

The only thing left was a taxi. Fortunately, there were some lonely taxis coming to the 
terminal. I caught one and asked if they accept euros. And they did! So we got to the 
T-Centralen with a load of our luggage.

{% include figure image_path="https://blog-image.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/sk%C3%B6ldpaddan-or-moving-to-sweden/2022-09-22-14-14-33.jpg" %}

When we got there we started actively using our advantage of being together. One of us was 
watching the luggage, while the other was going around doing something. That way we exchanged 
money, bought SL cards, and figured out what to do next. But here started our "we don't have 
a card" problem. We thought it would be easy to buy some sandwiches, considering everything 
went smoothly with the previous tasks. But at T-Centralen, we had our first encounter with 
not being able to pay with cash at cafes and restaurants.

We asked for some sandwiches and realized that our Swedish courses bore fruit as we understood 
what 'skinka' and 'ost' meant. But it didn't really help with buying stuff as our cash was not 
accepted. But the guy at the counter was really kind and paid for us with his card and we paid 
him back in cash. That was really nice of him. But that solution was not scalable. We had to 
figure out something else. Spoiler: use cash exchange services to send money via SWIFT to your 
Revolut account.

So we got our sandwiches and went to the hotel. We were somewhat tired, but it was fine. In 
Stockholm, you've got to really appreciate the amount of elevators and tools that help people 
with low mobility. They are everywhere. And they are working. With our luggage, we were able 
to get to the hotel using the local tram system without anyone's help.

After Helsinki's night walk on a brick pavement, I was really appreciating Stockholm's 
accessibility. I am confident that if something would have happened to us, we would be able to 
do things on our own.

### Where we lived -- Magnolia house

Magnolia house is located in the northwest of Stockholm. You have to take a so-called 
Pendelt√•g (commuter train) to get there. It's a really nice place. It's close to the water, 
there are a lot of trees, and it's really quiet. It took us some time to get to the place, 
as we had to carry our stuff for 1.5 kilometers. But then we got there...

Now, another little adventure. As we had _no internet_, we had to figure out how to get 
inside the house. And I couldn't just open the Airbnb app and check the instructions. 
Luckily, I had the email already downloaded. But to open it, I had to turn off mobile data 
and turn on wifi. And then I was able to open the email and get the instructions.

And now, it was time to relax, buy some groceries (with cash, yes), and go to sleep.

On the next day, Tanya had her first day at work, and mine was a week after.

During that week, I explored the area and walked around Stockholm a bit. I also wanted us 
to start working on documents as soon as possible.

But our short journey was over. Now we were to settle in the new place.

# Final word on 19.09.2023

It was a year since Tanya started working at KTH, since we moved to Sweden. So many things
happened during that time. A lot of them are good, like we made some great friends here and
traveled a lot. And some of it is not so good (Bureaucracy could be better sometimes).
Sometimes we spend time being nostalgic about Russia. And all that is good. Really good. I'm
just glad that we are together.

It's a shame that such a great transition is happening due to such a terrible event.

I think Tanya and I got more relaxed here. And we were stressed not only because of the war,
but I think generally life in a way was more stressful. Though we had a pretty good and
exciting life with a lot of travel between Saint-Petersburg and Moscow, we stayed in the
house a lot. I think the sleep deprivation and our work being too intertwined with our
personal life affected us.

Despite the work not being as phenomenal as it was at SberDevices, it still seems really
meaningful. And I think that my colleagues are really nice and responsible people. And in
the end, I'm really happy to work with them. I want to learn Swedish, I want to hang out
with them during retreats and be able to have fun.

I do believe that this is just the beginning of our journey.
