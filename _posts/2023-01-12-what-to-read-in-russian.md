# What to read and watch in English about Russia (in my opinion)

This list contains bloggers and content creators that do something to reach English speaking audience. I watch all of
them and consider them worthy of your attention if you want to see, what Russian opposition to current regime talks
about.

If you want to add something to this list, please consider writing to me blog@chur.ru or add an issue on github with
suggested resource. This post will be updated as I discover more content creators.

# Motivation

I decided to write this post for a couple of reasons. Firstly, after I moved to Sweden, I've been talking to people
there and they were asking me about politics, Russian sociology and events. I of course told everything I know, but in my
opinion it's always better to check out source material to create your own opinion. As so I offered them to check out
stuff that I considered interesting.

But while preparing this list, I decided to check, if such list has already been made. This led me to google and look
around in general, if I was an English speaking person, what would I find if I'd search "Where to read Russian news".
This is the first link on google: https://blog.feedspot.com/russian_news_websites/. Some of there resources are pretty
good, some really good, but some should be considered as government propaganda and either be avoided or read with
caution, because propaganda works really hard and unfortunately well.

As a result, I've got a list of content creators that are worth checking out.

WARNING. There is no order in this list, but alphabetical one, So don't think that the first one in this list is more
important than the last one. Please check them all out.

# Где дела делаются

The main platforms right now are Telegram and YouTube as they are not blocked in Russia. But resources provided in this
post are available either on YouTube or as websites. 

In the last section of this post I wrote about resources that
better be avoided or read with caution because they promote Putin's government position or directly sponsored by it.
I'm writing here about them in order to give a full picture available resources.

# Influencers

## Ilya Varlamov -- journalist

[English channel](https://www.youtube.com/@VarlamovEng)

Independent journalist. He writes and creates videos about urbanistics, politics and news. He is always trying to 
give a big picture perspective on events and news. Despite cursing a lot, it's a really good watch if you want to
actually see modern problems in Russian cities.

## Maxim Katz -- politician

[Russian channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Max_Katz), but all videos after the start of the war have English subtitles.

Politician. On his channel he is publishing videos every day, commenting current events. He is worth checking out
because he makes videos in calm and constructive manner.

## Yriy Dud' -- interviewer

[Russian channel](https://www.youtube.com/@vdud), but almost all videos have English subtitles.

Interviews channel. Interviews are extremely important right now, because through them you can discover different
opinions on the same subject. His channel is considered as one of the best Russian interview shows on youtube right now
and many other channels are trying to mimic his style.

It's normal to not know what to choose to watch, so I'll suggest you some videos that personally I find worth watching:

- [How dictatorship works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARaX2djZYFw)
- [Why They Torture People in Russia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_2Vy9B8hic)
- [The Navalniys Post-poisoning (English subs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vps43rXgaZc)
- [Kolyma - Birthplace of Our Fear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo1WouI38rQ)

## Telegram channel about crossing of Russian border

Reports from people on how they crossed Russian border. Stories are added daily, so you can find previous critical days and see how it was

## NFKRZ -- blogger

[English channel](https://www.youtube.com/@roman_nfkrz)

A normal guy-blogger with a really good English accent, who gives perspective and simple man view on current events. Worth
watching just for the good English and well made videos on Russia.

## I heard about Navalniy. What about him?

He is currently is in prison and all messages from him come through his visitors. They are published mostly on twitter
as they are done in text form.

As for his comrades, I personally can't recommend their content as I don't find it particularly interesting. But
Navalniy's old content is pure gold. If you've never seen his investigations I **highly** recommend watching them. New
ones are pretty good as well, but they kind of feels not relevant right now.

- [Palace for Putin. History of the largest bribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAnwilMncI)
- [Don't call him Dimon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_GF9g)

## Ekaterina Shulman

https://t.me/eschulmann

Unfortunately, she doesn't have English channel, but she has Telegram channel which could be translated and some
Interviews and talks.

# Blacklist: avoid it or read with caution and criticism

## RT -- [Russia today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network))

This is a Russian government sponsored news media. A well established, yes. But it's a Putin's propaganda channel and
should be treated accordingly. Just read Wikipedia article on 
["Propaganda and related issues"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)#Propaganda_and_related_issues).

If you think that you can handle it, you are wrong. A lot of people fall to how they present information. As stated in
[this
article](https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/03/how-many-people-really-watch-or-read-rt-anyway-its-hard-to-tell-but-some-of-their-social-numbers-are-eye-popping/)
"RT doesn’t need a _huge_ audience to be influential — only the _right_ one".
