# Tl;Dr

On 24-28 of May there was PyCon Italy in Florence. I decided to go there, because there were a bunch of interesting talks. And
It's Florence!

# Conference

[PyCon Italy 2023](pycon.it/) took place in Florence Italy. The conference was worth coming on-site as there were some interesting workshops (workshops were not recorded) and I met many interesting people.

As for the talks, fortunately they were recorded as online stream and they are already available on YouTube.


### :star: **Awesome talks** 

[Site reliability engineering when your team is too small for a full time SRE](https://www.youtube.com/live/4f23X0UuT-0?feature=share&t=23994) <br>
Really good talk with a good overview of how SRE could be done with what tools. 

### :heart: **I really liked it**

[5 Things about fastAPI I wish we had known beforehand](https://www.youtube.com/live/7C-ZG0lnEOg?feature=share&t=20156)

Pretty good talk if you know what FastAPI and used it a bit.

### :+1: **Good watch**

[Saving time, money and sanity by Pythonizing Google Slides](https://www.youtube.com/live/C5uscUkltA0?feature=share&t=24237) <br>
Fun presentation. But the main this is this thing https://github.com/slidoapp/sliger It’s basically jinja templates usage for google slides. It could be useful for people who have to do a lot of similar presentations but with a few changes that could be templated like: date, company name, plots

[Develop modern games in Python the old-school way](https://www.youtube.com/live/nUmolZkWQIg?feature=share&t=27418)<br>

Nuitka3 – compiles python code to single executable<br>

[Rust is easy](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch3Bs3K4Oeo?feature=share&t=7873)<br>
Nice talk which shows rust from bottom up.

[Creating an AI-Python Infrastructure that works with a reasonable scale](https://www.youtube.com/live/ye2s1smuYe8?feature=share&t=5722)<br>
MLOps tools description<br>
Project template that they use https://github.com/PythonBiellaGroup/Bear<br>
Pretty good talk for overview for MLOps and ML infrastructure

[Debugging that bugger : Cleanly handling the errors](https://www.youtube.com/live/z77kTTJ9AHg?feature=share&t=23276)<br>
This talk reminded me that assert statement is skipped during runs of your script if you run it like this: `python -O script.py`

# Trip as a whole

Florence is beautiful.
